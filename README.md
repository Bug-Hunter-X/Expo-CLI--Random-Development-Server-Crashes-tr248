# Expo CLI Random Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly crashes without providing helpful error messages.  The issue is intermittent and makes debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The Expo development server inexplicably terminates during development. No error messages are displayed in the terminal, making it difficult to identify the root cause. This behavior is inconsistent and occurs randomly during development sessions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the server might crash at random times without any apparent reason.
